For DeepDream, the layers of  interest are those where the convolutions are concatenated. There are 11 of these layers in InceptionV3, named 'mixed0' though 'mixed10'. Using different layers will result in different dream-like images. Deeper layers respond to higher-level features (such as eyes and faces), while earlier layers respond to simpler features (such as edges, shapes, and textures). Feel free to experiment with the layers selected below, but keep in mind that deeper layers (those with a higher index) will take longer to train on since the gradient computation is deeper."
